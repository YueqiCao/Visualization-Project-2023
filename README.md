# Visualization Project in 2023 Warwick Computational Algebraic Geometry Workshop

This repository contains codes to make animations (gif,mp4,mov,...) of certains objects in algebraic geometry and tropical geometry. Using these codes we can visualize 

- Homotopy between two algebraic varieties defined by two polynomials;
- Continuous deformation of amoebas to tropical curves.

This is a part of the visualization project of [2023 Computational Algebraic Geometry Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/warwickcompalggeom/home) at University of Warwick. The codes are written by Julia and based on [Oscar.jl](https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/).
